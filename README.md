The primary goal of this project is to use score-audio alignment to extract performance data. The project is also useful for more generalized linking of audio- and score-based representations with annotations.  

This code repository translates some of the existing tools from Matlab to Python, primarily using the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) and [music21](https://web.mit.edu/music21/) libraries.

# PIP package
pyAMPACT is available as a ([pip package](https://pypi.org/project/pyampact/))
